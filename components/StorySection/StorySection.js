                <p className='ourLoveStory'>Welcome to our celebration of love that transcends distance! Our love story began with a connection, sparked by a beloved family friend and Olivierâ€™s aunt. Little did we know, she saw the potential that would blossom into a deep bond and everlasting love. As we prepare to embark on this journey, we invite you to join us in celebrating our traditional ceremony, a harmonious celebration of Rwandan tradition. As we unite our lives in our tapestry of cultures and shared love orchestrated by God, will look forward to your presence.
